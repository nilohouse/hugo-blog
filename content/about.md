Right from the big bubble burst on the early 2000's, started this journey writing PHP 3 and Javascript code for a small web agency. By that time there was no Fullstack, Progressive Web Apps and stuff -- if you could make things look good you would become a designer, if you could code you would become a developer (or a programmer as I was entitled then).

Around 2005 got my hands on some big monolithic Java 5 webapp built on top of JSP, scriptlets and bad practices, but it felt awesome. The team responsible for the project had quit the agency and I was the only developer left. With the task of porting our biggest project to a flagship product and no team (and no money), we had to be creative. And then began a 5 year run where I not only learned the craft by trial and error but also met some people that became friends for life.

By 2010 I was a new born father making some decent money as a Tech Lead but the feeling of burnout was so big that I decided make a shift on my career.

Since 2017 I've been helping the AppsClub to estabilish it's presence all around the globe by coding some Java and Go microservices and adding new features to our Android product. Still feeling as an outsider when messing around with Activities and Fragments but I'm having a blast.
