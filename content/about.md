Right from the big bubble burst on the early 2000's, started this journey writing PHP 3 and Javascript code for a small web agency. By that time there was no Fullstack, Progressive Web Apps and stuff -- if you could make things look good you would become a designer, if you could code you would become a developer (or a programmer as I was entitled then).

Around 2005 got my hands on some big monolithic Java 5 webapp built on top of JSP, scriptlets and bad practices. It felt awesome, even though the team responsible for the project had just quit the agency and I was the only developer left. With the task of porting our biggest project into a flagship product and no team (and no money too), we had to be creative. Then began a 5 year run where I not only learned the craft by trial and error but also met some people that became friends for life.

By 2010 I was a new born father making some decent money as a Development Coordinator but the feeling of burnout was so big that a major career shift seemed like the the only way to go. The brazilian tech industry had just started drinking the Agile kool aid and I couldn't see myself as a PM drawing Grant charts or tracking man-hours. After diving head first into Extreme Programming, Lean and Scrum it became clear that my boat needed to sail on different waters.



Since 2017 I've been helping the AppsClub to estabilish it's presence all around the globe by coding some Java and Go microservices and adding new features to our Android product. Still feeling as an outsider when messing around with Activities and Fragments but I'm having a blast.
