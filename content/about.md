Right from the big bubble burst on the early 2000's, started this journey writing some PHP 3 and Javascript code for a small web agency. By that time there was no Fullstack, Progressive Web Apps and stuff -- you were either a developer or a programmer (as I was entitled then).

Around 2005 got my hands on some big monolithic Java 5 webapp full of JSP and scriptlets.
